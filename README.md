# Vertical Bookmarks with Hover Activation

A simple browser extension that adds a vertical bookmarks sidebar with hover activation. Mostly just made this because I'm not a fan of the regular horizontal bookmarks bar - this one keeps all your bookmarks organized vertically on the side of your browser.

**Note:** This isn't on the Chrome Web Store (yet), so you'll need to install it manually using developer mode. Don't worry, it's pretty straightforward!

## What It Does

- Shows a vertical sidebar on the right side of your browser
- Displays all your existing bookmarks
- Activates on hover (hover near the edge to open it)
- Works on any website

## Installation

Since this isn't published yet, you'll need to install it manually:

### Step 1: Download the Extension

1. Click the green "Code" button at the top of this page
2. Select "Download ZIP"
3. Unzip the file on your computer

### Step 2: Enable Developer Mode in Chrome/Edge

1. Open Chrome or Edge
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/` for Edge)
3. **Turn ON Developer mode** (toggle in the top right corner)

### Step 3: Install the Extension

1. Click the "Load unpacked" button
2. Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the extension
3. Select the folder and click "Select Folder"
4. Done! The extension should now appear in your extensions list

## How to Use

1. Navigate to any website
2. Move your mouse to the right edge of your browser
3. The bookmarks sidebar should appear with all your bookmarks
4. Hover away to hide it again

## Permissions

The extension needs the following permissions (all standard for bookmark extensions):
- Access to your bookmarks (to display them)
- The ability to inject the sidebar on web pages
- Storage to remember your preferences

## Troubleshooting

- **Sidebar not appearing?** Make sure the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
- **Having permission issues?** The extension will ask for permissions when first installed
- **Want to remove it?** Just click the trash icon in `chrome://extensions/`
